        <h3>What is artifical intelligence</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is intelligence created artificially, hence the word artificial. Artificial Intelligence or AI allows machines to learn from experience and become closer to thinking for themselves. The term artificial intelligence was first made in 1956 however it was not popularised until recently as computers got faster and smaller. </p>
